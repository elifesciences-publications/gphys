\details{
You can use functions such as
\code{\link{PlotRasterFromSweeps}} to view spike data. This function and others
depend on spike times stored in Igor Pro text files. For details of how to make
these files in Igor see:

\url{http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=protocols:analysing_spikes}

Spike times read in from Igor Pro text files by \code{\link{CollectSpikesFromSweeps}}
are stored in R a modified list of S3 class \code{spiketimes}.
You can add, subset and split these lists - see \code{\link{spiketimes}}
and links therein for details.

You can also add continuous traces such as membrane voltage, PID signals etc
to your raster plots. See \code{\link{AddLinesToRasterPlot}}.

If you have a mistake in the assignments of your ODD channels (e.g. you were
opening channel 27 when you thought you were opening 29) you will likely need
to use the function \code{\link{fix.odd}} to make the correct assignments. If
you simply want to relabel a channel you can use the \code{relabelfun}
argument of \code{\link{PlotRasterFromSweeps}} - see function documentation for
examples.

Note that you may find it useful to set e.g.
\code{options(gphys.datadir='/Volumes/JData/JPeople/Jonny/physiology/data')}
appropriately at the start of a session or in your 
\code{\link[=Startup]{.Rprofile}} file. You can then use relative paths to
your Igor data folders in the plot functions.

Finally \code{\link{as.repeatedTrain}} provides a bridge to the \code{\link{STAR}}
package which includes many spike analysis functions including (smoothed)
peristimulus time histograms.
