\title{Produce table of spiking responses (optionally subtracting baseline)}
\usage{
OdourResponseFromSpikes(spiketimes, responseWindow, baselineWindow = NULL,
  freq = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spiketimes}{list of spiketimes collected by CollectSpikesFromSweeps}

\item{responseWindow}{vector of start and end time of odour response (in ms)}

\item{baselineWindow}{vector of start and end time of baseline period (in ms)}

\item{freq}{Calculate Spike rate in Hz rather than number of spikes per response window}
}
\value{
dataframe with a column for each odour and row for each sweep
}
\description{
Details: If baseline window is of different duration to response window
the baseline count is normalised to estimate the number of spikes that would have
occurred during the response window. ie if you have a 1s response window and a
5s baseline window and you get 10 spikes in the response period and 5 spikes in
the baseline period, the response will be returned as 10-5/5 = 9 spikes.
