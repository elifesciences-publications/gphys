\description{
Details: this is designed for the case where you have loaded in multiple
pxp files into separate spiketimes lists, BUT the pxp files were all acquired
with the same ODD config (and presumably Igor protocol). It does not matter
if they have the same or a different number of repeats (ie individual data frames),
but they must have the same number of rows in the odd config.
Example use: Igor crashed and you ended up with one recording split into 
2 cell folders XXXc0 and XXXc1. Use CollectSpikesFromSweeps to read spike
files from both folders independently and then join them together with this
function.
